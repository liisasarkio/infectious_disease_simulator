## Checkpoint1

## Current properties

What properties have you already implemented into your project? What can be done with the program at this point?

Unfortunately I haven't had a ton of time to work on my project yet due to finishing the last practice rounds for this course.
I have implemented the basic structure for the parent class Brain, which is central to the program. I have started on working
on one of the subclasses of Brain as well as the Square class
However, most of Brain's methods will be reimplemented in its subclasses.

## Instructions

 - Is it possible to run the program already? (yes/no) no
 - How is the program executed?
 The visible part for the program as well as the communication with the user will be done with a graphic user interface.
 I will execute this with PyQt6. The underlying structure will rely on the different classes and the simple AI's of the "characters"
 or instances of Brain in the simulation.

## Schedule

 - How much time have you spent making the project this far?
 At first I had some troubles with git, so together probably 5 hours.
 - Have you made changes to the schedule of your project plan?
 No.

## Other

 - Have you faced any specific problems?
 No. Unfortunately I have yet to properly started the implementation.
 - Have you had to make changes to your plan?
 No.
